# White-Elephant
Full CRUD Application

## Description

My Fiance and I do a White Elephant with all of our friends during Christmas as a tradition. I wanted to get ahead this year and create an application where we can create anonymous user names. After creating a user name we are then able to create a gift idea, paste a link and leave a message. We are also able to edit and delete gifts.

Authentication was done with bcrypt, all users and gifts are stored in a MySQL database.
Bootstrap was used along with some css magic. 

### Built With

* Java
* Spring Boot
